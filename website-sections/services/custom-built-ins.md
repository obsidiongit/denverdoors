### Overview
**Title:** Custom Built-Ins
**Subtitle:** Maximizing Space with Tailored Storage
**Intro:** Off-the-shelf furniture never quite fits. Our custom built-ins are designed to fit your specific nook, cranny, or wall perfectly—giving you storage that looks like it was part of the original blueprint.

### Popular Projects
- **Mudroom Lockers:** Conquer the chaos of backpacks, boots, and coats with designated cubbies and benches.
- **Entertainment Centers:** Hide the wires and frame the TV with custom shelving and cabinets.
- **Window Seats:** Add storage and a cozy reading spot to a bay window or bedroom.
- **Floating Shelves:** Clean, modern display space with no visible brackets.
- **Pantry Systems:** sturdy, custom shelving to organize your kitchen life.

### Our Process
1.  **Measure & Design:** We laser-measure your space and sketch the layout.
2.  **Shop Fabrication:** We build the carcasses and face frames in our shop to minimize mess in your home.
3.  **Installation:** We scribe the unit to your walls and floor for a gap-free fit.
4.  **Trim & Finish:** Crown molding and baseboard tie the built-in into the rest of the room.
