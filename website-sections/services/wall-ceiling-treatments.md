# Wall & Ceiling Treatments Specifications

## Content

### Overview
**Title:** Wall & Ceiling Treatments
**Subtitle:** Add Texture and Character to Any Room
**Intro:** Paint is great, but dimensional woodwork adds a layer of depth and luxury that color alone can't achieve. From farmhouse shiplap to elegant wainscoting, we create accent walls that become the focal point of your home.

### Treatment Options
- **Shiplap:** Horizontal or vertical nickel-gap boards for a clean, modern farmhouse look.
- **Wainscoting:** Board and batten, beadboard, or raised panel details to protect walls and add style.
- **Tongue & Groove Ceilings:** Bring warmth to a room with wood-clad ceilings (natural pine, cedar, or painted).
- **Accent Beams:** Faux or solid wood beams to add architectural interest to high ceilings.

### Design Impact
- **Acoustics:** Wood treatments can help dampen sound in large, echoey rooms.
- **Durability:** Wainscoting protects high-traffic hallways and dining rooms from scuffs and dings.
- **Resale Value:** Custom woodwork is a highly desirable feature for homebuyers.
