# Trim & Baseboard Installation Specifications

## Content

### Overview
**Title:** Trim & Baseboard Installation
**Subtitle:** The Frame for Your Home’s Design
**Intro:** Trim is the architectural eyeliner of a room. Whether you want the clean, modern lines of square stock or the classic elegance of colonial moulding, our precision installation makes the difference between "done" and "designed."

### Styles We Install
- **Modern / Craftsman:** Flat stock (1x4, 1x6) with simple eased edges.
- **Traditional:** Colonial, Ogee, and detailed profiles.
- **Crown Molding:** Add height and elegance to any room.
- **Window & Door Casings:** Picture-frame your views with perfectly mitered corners.

### The Craftsmanship Difference
- **Coped Joints:** We cope our inside corners (instead of just organizing miters) so they stay tight even when wood expands and contracts.
- **Seamless Joints:** Long runs are scarfed and sanded for invisible seams.
- **Paint-Ready:** We leave our work filled, caulked, and ready for the painter (or we can coordinate finishing).
