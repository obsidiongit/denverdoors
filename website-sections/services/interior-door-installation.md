## Content

### Overview
**Title:** Interior Door Installation
**Subtitle:** Upgrade Your Home with Solid, Sound-Dampening Doors
**Intro:** Interior doors are often overlooked, but they are one of the most tactile elements in your home. We replace hollow, flimsy builder-grade doors with solid-core options that dampen sound, close with a satisfying "thud," and elevate the feel of every room.

### key Features
- **Solid Core Upgrades:** Drastically reduce noise transfer between rooms (perfect for home offices and nurseries).
- **Precision Hanging:** We ensure every door is plumb, level, and swings freely without "ghosting" (swinging open or closed on its own).
- **Hardware Installation:** We install handles, hinges, and latches with perfect alignment.

### Service Options
- **Pre-Hung Doors:** Best for new rough openings or when frames are damaged.
- **Slab Replacement:** We custom-machine new slabs to fit your existing jambs—less mess, same great result.
- **Barn Doors:** Sliding barn door installation for space-saving style.
- **Pocket Doors:** Repair or replacement of sticking pocket doors.
