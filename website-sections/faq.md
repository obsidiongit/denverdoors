### Overview
**Title:** Frequently Asked Questions
**Subtitle:** Everything you need to know about our services.

### Installation & Process
**Q: How long does a door installation take?**
A typical home (10-15 doors) usually takes 1-2 days to complete. We work efficiently to minimize disruption to your routine.

**Q: Do I need to be home during the work?**
Ideally, someone is home to let us in and for the initial walkthrough, but you essentially free to leave once we get started. We just need access to the work areas.

**Q: Do you paint the doors and trim?**
Our specialty is carpentry and installation. We offer "paint-ready" installation (caulked and filled) or pre-finished options. For on-site painting, we can recommend trusted local painters we work with frequently.

### Materials & Sourcing
**Q: Do I need to buy the doors myself?**
You can, but you don't have to! We have relationships with top suppliers and can source high-quality doors and hardware for you, often at better rates than big-box stores.

**Q: What is the difference between hollow core and solid core?**
Hollow core doors are lightweight and budget-friendly. Solid core doors are heavier, feel more substantial, and are much better at blocking sound. We highly recommend solid core for bedrooms and bathrooms.

### Service Area & Pricing
**Q: What areas do you serve?**
We serve the entire Denver Metro area, including Golden, Lakewood, Arvada, Littleton, Centennial, Highlands Ranch, and Parker.

**Q: Are your estimates free?**
Yes! We provide free, detailed estimates for all projects. Contact us to schedule a consultation.
