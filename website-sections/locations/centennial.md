### Overview
**Title:** Centennial Door & Trim Experts
**Subtitle:** Modernizing Suburban Living
**Intro:** Centennial homes have great bones, but many are stuck in the 90s with golden oak trim and hollow core doors. We specialize in comprehensive updates that transform these houses into modern, bright, and quiet sanctuaries.

### The "Oak-B-Gone" Specialist
- **Trim Replacement:** We remove dated oak baseboards and casings and install fresh, white, taller profiles.
- **Door Swaps:** Replacing entire households of hollow wood-grain doors with smooth, solid-core painted doors.
- **Staircase Updates:** Replacing turned oak balusters with sleek iron or square wood spindles.

### Why Upgrade?
Upgrading your doors and trim is the single most effective way to make a 20-year-old home feel brand new without moving walls.
