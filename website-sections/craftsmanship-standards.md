# Craftsmanship Standards Specifications

## Content

### Overview
**Title:** Our Craftsmanship Standards
**Subtitle:** The Detailed Difference
**Intro:** Anyone can swing a hammer. At Denver Interior & Doors Co., we believe finish carpentry is an art form. It’s the final layer of your home—the part you see and touch every day. Here is our promise of quality to you.

### Core Pillars

#### 1. Precision & Accuracy
We don't guess. We use laser levels, digital angle finders, and scribe-fitting techniques to ensure every door hangs dead plumb and every miter joint is tight. No gaps, no rubbing, no excuses.

#### 2. Quality Materials
We exclusively use high-grade materials.
- **Doors:** Solid core or premium hollow core—never cheap, flimsy builder-grade slabs (unless requested).
- **Trim:** Poplar or pine for paint-grade (no MDF in wet areas), and premium hardwoods for stain-grade.
- **Hardware:** Ball-bearing hinges for smooth operation that lasts.

#### 3. Respect for Your Home
We treat your home like our own.
- **Dust Control:** We use HEPA vacuums and dust barriers to keep the mess contained.
- **Floor Protection:** We cover your floors in our work zones.
- **Clean Up:** We sweep and vacuum at the end of every day, not just the end of the job.

### Our Process
1.  **Consultation & Estimate:** We listen to your vision and provide a transparent quote.
2.  **Measurement:** We verify every opening to ensure a perfect fit.
3.  **Fabrication:** Doors and trim are prepped off-site whenever possible to minimize noise and dust.
4.  **Installation:** Our skilled carpenters install, shim, and fasten everything securely.
5.  **The Walkthrough:** We don’t leave until you’ve inspected our work and are 100% satisfied.
