# Stair Railing Systems Gallery Specifications

## SEO
- **Title Tag:** Stair Railing & Banister Replacement Gallery | Denver, CO
- **Meta Description:** Update your staircase with modern metal balusters, new oak handrails, or box newel posts. View our railing makeovers in Denver.
- **Target Keywords:** stair railing installation denver, banister replacement, metal balusters

## Content Strategy
Staircases are often the first thing you see in a home. Focus on the "Modernization" aspect—replacing 90s golden oak with specific modern combinations (White oak + black metal).

### Intro Text
**Headline:** Elevate Your Staircase
**Body:** The centerpiece of your home deserves better than squeaky, dated oak rails. We specialize in railing transformations that modernize your entire entryway.

### Gallery Categories
1. **Modern Metal:** Black horizontal bars or vertical iron balusters.
2. **Contemporary Wood:** Box newels, clean lines, square balusters.
3. **Handrails:** White oak, maple, walnut custom profiles.

## Layout Reference
- **Hero:** Vertical shot looking up/down a spiral or landing turnaround to show flow.
- **Before/After Focus:** This category relies heavily on showing the "Before" (usually 90s builder grade) vs "After".

## Components to Use
### Before/After Slider (Heavy Use)
- **Component:** `BeforeAfterSlider`
- **Quantity:** 3-4 distinct examples.
- **Captions:** "Replaced golden oak turnings with matte black iron and square box newels."

### Detail Grid
- **Component:** `DetailPhotoGrid`

    - Newel post caps
    - Handrail returns into the wall
    - Baluster "shoes" (base covers)

## Design Instructions
