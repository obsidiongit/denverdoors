## Notes for Development

- **Location pages** should each have unique copy referencing the specific city/suburb — avoid duplicate content.
- **Service pages** should include: hero, description, process, photo gallery embed, FAQ accordion, and a CTA to book.
- **Blog posts** should be 800–1,500 words, include internal links to relevant service pages, and target one primary keyword per post.
- **Schema markup** recommended on: Home (LocalBusiness), Service pages (Service), Blog posts (Article), FAQ page (FAQPage).
- **Internal linking** priority: Blog posts → Service pages → Contact/Booking.
